# Conductor

Central library of reusable custom effects, statuses, and keywords to make modding in monster train 2 safer and easier.

## Installation

Firstly add Conductor to your dependencies in your thunderstore.toml file 

If testing locally be sure grab a copy from releases and extract the contents of the folder to your `BepinEx/plugins` folder.

(Coming shortly) If using Conductor's utility functions a dependency must be added in your csproj file along with installing the nuget package.

## Usage

To learn what Conductor can do for you, be sure to check our [wiki](https://github.com/Monster-Train-2-Modding-Group/Conductor/wiki). This library is meant to be used as a dependency for other mods. 

**Do not copy code or json from any file in this repository as it won't work in your own project**! Instead, reference the effects and classes from within your own json files.
