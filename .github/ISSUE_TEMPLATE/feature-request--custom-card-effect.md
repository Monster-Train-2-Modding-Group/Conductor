**Describe the card effect**
A clear and concise description of the card effect as best you can and how none of the existing card effects present in the game, or in this repository fit your needs. 

*Example*

Please check [old wiki](https://github.com/brandonandzeus/Trainworks2/wiki/Base-Game-CardEffects) which explains a good majority of the card effects before requesting. Its best to review the cards available in the game and find a card with a similar effect to what you want, often times simply changing a few parameters will get the effect to do what you want.



<sub>A reminder that to be accepted the card effect must be reusable, ultra clan specific stuff can be requested in the mt-modding channel on discord.</sub>

<sub>Note if you aren't modding the game yourself please don't use this to request content to be made for you, the issue will be closed. This is only for modders to request a novel effect that can't be done with the codebase so that they can make content.</sub>
