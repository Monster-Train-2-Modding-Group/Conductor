**Describe the keyword**
A clear and concise description of the keyword as best you can and how none of the existing keywords fit your needs. Keywords are things like (Doublestack, Piercing, Consume) present at the top of the card text that aren't status effects. You should include at least the following information:

 * What are the properties of the trait (for instance, is a card with the keyword discardable? copyable?, interactions with other cards, etc.)
 * What happens when the trait is applied to a card?
 * What happens when a card with the trait is played?
 * Any interactions with other stuff that should be considered? (Incompatibility with other keywords)

<sub>A reminder that to be accepted the trait must be reusable, ultra clan specific stuff can be requested in the mt-modding channel on discord.</sub>

<sub>Note if you aren't modding the game yourself please don't use this to request content to be made for you, the issue will be closed. This is only for modders to request a novel effect that can't be done with the codebase so that they can make content.</sub>
