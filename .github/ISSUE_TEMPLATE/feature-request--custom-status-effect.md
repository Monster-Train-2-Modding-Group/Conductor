**Describe the status effect**
A clear and concise description of the status effect as best you can. You should include at least the following information:

 * The status effect type whether it is a Buff (green), Debuff (red), or Persistent (yellow)?
 * When should it trigger (end of combat, start of combat, when hit, etc)?
 * Is it stackable? If so when should stacks be removed?
 * Any interactions with other stuff. (ex. Not eligible for Doublestack, Dualism, etc.)

It would also be helpful if a sprite for your requested status be provided. Two icons sized 24x24 should be provided a black and white image of the status effect and an another with a transparent background and white only (see: status_intangible.png and status_intangible_tooltip.png [here](https://github.com/Monster-Train-2-Modding-Group/Conductor/tree/main/Conductor/textures)

<sub>A reminder that to be accepted the status effect must be reusable, ultra clan specific stuff can be requested in the mt-modding channel on discord.</sub>
