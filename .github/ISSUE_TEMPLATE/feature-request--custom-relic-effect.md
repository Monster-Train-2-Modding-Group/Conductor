**Describe the relic effect**
A clear and concise description of the relic effect as best you can and how none of the existing relic effects present in the game, or in this repository fit your needs. 


<sub>A reminder that to be accepted the relic effect must be reusable, ultra clan specific stuff can be requested in the mt-modding channel on discord.</sub>

<sub>Note if you aren't modding the game yourself please don't use this to request content to be made for you, the issue will be closed. This is only for modders to request a novel effect that can't be done with the codebase so that they can make content.</sub>
