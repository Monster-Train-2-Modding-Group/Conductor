**Describe the trigger**
A clear and concise description of the trigger as best you can. You should include at least the following information:

 * The type of trigger (Card or Character)?
 * What event should cause this trigger to fire?
 * (Character Triggers only) Is this a passive trigger type? (example Vangaurd) these triggers have a condition once true triggers once, and when the condition is no longer true removes the effect gained.
 * Is the trigger allowed to fire in the deployment phase?
 * Any interactions with other stuff that should be considered.

It would also be helpful if a sprite for your requested trigger be provided. This should be an icon sized 50x50 that gets used in the UI.

<sub>A reminder that to be accepted the trigger must be reusable, ultra clan specific stuff can be requested in the mt-modding channel on discord.</sub>
